| --------- | ------- |
| September 5, 2024   |  First class of the year, discussed class structure. Decided to create a game and to learn C#.       |
| September 6, 2024   |  We finished our journals, decided to use Godot and learn C# through Codecademy. |
| September 10, 2024  |  We discussed options and decided to switch to learning GDscript, because most developers use GDscript with Godot so it will be easier to find tips/tutorials. We found some resources to learn GDscript, including the app learn GDscript from zero. We completed some lessons on this app, and I got up to lesson 6 learning functions.|
| September 12, 2024  | Continued working on the lessons, reached up to lesson 15 explaining 2D vectors. Completed lessons explaining variables, if-statements, and functions specific to Godot. We also discussed a timeline for finishing the course.     |
| September 13, 2024          |  Only completed one lesson today because we were having deep conversations,, whoops. Talked about potential timeline for finishing/class schedule.   |
