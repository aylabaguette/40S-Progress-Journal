| **Date**  | **Tasks** |
| --------- | ------- |
| September 5, 2024   |  First class of the year, discussed class structure. Decided to create a game and to learn C#.       |
| September 6, 2024   |  We finished our journals, decided to use Godot and learn C# through Codecademy. |
| September 10, 2024  |  We discussed options and decided to switch to learning GDscript, because most developers use GDscript with Godot so it will be easier to find tips/tutorials. We found some resources to learn GDscript, including the app learn GDscript from zero. We completed some lessons on this app, and I got up to lesson 6 learning functions.|
| September 12, 2024  | Continued working on the lessons, reached up to lesson 15 explaining 2D vectors. Completed lessons explaining variables, if-statements, and functions specific to Godot. We also discussed a timeline for finishing the course.     |
| September 13, 2024          |  Only completed one lesson today because we were having deep conversations,, whoops. Talked about potential timeline for finishing/class schedule.   |
| September 20, 2024          |  Completed up to lesson 20, covered while loops, for loops, and arrays. Very similar except some different syntax, and it is annoying me that variables don't really have types. some notes I took today, mostly on the syntax differences. <img width="610" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 3 09 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364cde4c-6c90-4f72-b54e-e1321af521d3">|
| September 24, 2024          |    Completed up to lesson 25, covered returning in a function, more arrays, and something more new, dictionaries. Although this is the first real new concept they are similar to arrays and not that confusing.      |
| September 26, 2024 | Completed the course ! I finished learning about dictionaries and some other details about variables. Looking into what the next steps to take after everyone finishes the course |
| September 27, 2024 | Started watching a video about Godot basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0 learned some basic things like how to make a new file and upload files, and then how to make character animations. |
| October 1, 2024 | Continued with youtube tutorial, learned how to make a tilemap, some animations, and how to "pick up" items. |
| October 4, 2024 | Worked on video, made a world barrier/kill player and the enemy. This my progress so far: <img width="655" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 at 3 03 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553cbd4d-9672-4abe-9d41-71926a2e1bf7"> |
| October 8, 2024 | Finished the video! Worked on some fixes in the game, like adding new animations, enemy behavior, score, and audio. Talked about next steps (playing around with making own game)| 
| October 9, 2024 | Spent a lot of hours in and outside of class working on my own mini game. Decided to make it top down this time to figure something different out. However, I struggled a lot without the tutorial. I downloaded some free assets, made a map and sprite animation, and worked on some wall colliders in the tilemap. However since I was coding from my brain instead of a tutorial I didn't know that there was a line of code I missed to make the colliders work, but I figured it out eventually. Had a lot of other problems too though. Next I am going to try to make an inventory I think? |
| October 10, 2024 | Added some animations to my own game, tried to make an inventory but gave up! Will try again later. Moved on to randomizing spawning some coins on the tilemap, currently working on that. |
