| **Date**  | **Tasks** |
| --------- | ------- |
| September 5, 2024   |  First class of the year, discussed class structure. Decided to create a game and to learn C#.       |
| September 6, 2024   |  We finished our journals, decided to use Godot and learn C# through Codecademy. |
| September 10, 2024  |  We discussed options and decided to switch to learning GDscript, because most developers use GDscript with Godot so it will be easier to find tips/tutorials. We found some resources to learn GDscript, including the app learn GDscript from zero. We completed some lessons on this app, and I got up to lesson 6 learning functions.|
| September 12, 2024  | Continued working on the lessons, reached up to lesson 15 explaining 2D vectors. Completed lessons explaining variables, if-statements, and functions specific to Godot. We also discussed a timeline for finishing the course.     |
| September 13, 2024          |  Only completed one lesson today because we were having deep conversations,, whoops. Talked about potential timeline for finishing/class schedule.   |
| September 20, 2024          |  Completed up to lesson 20, covered while loops, for loops, and arrays. Very similar except some different syntax, and it is annoying me that variables don't really have types. some notes I took today, mostly on the syntax differences. <img width="610" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 3 09 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364cde4c-6c90-4f72-b54e-e1321af521d3">|
| September 24, 2024          |    Completed up to lesson 25, covered returning in a function, more arrays, and something more new, dictionaries. Although this is the first real new concept they are similar to arrays and not that confusing.      |
| September 26, 2024 | Completed the course ! I finished learning about dictionaries and some other details about variables. Looking into what the next steps to take after everyone finishes the course |
| September 27, 2024 | Started watching a video about Godot basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0 learned some basic things like how to make a new file and upload files, and then how to make character animations. |
| October 1, 2024 | Continued with youtube tutorial, learned how to make a tilemap, some animations, and how to "pick up" items. |
| October 4, 2024 | Worked on video, made a world barrier/kill player and the enemy. This my progress so far: <img width="655" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 at 3 03 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553cbd4d-9672-4abe-9d41-71926a2e1bf7"> |
| October 8, 2024 | Finished the video! Worked on some fixes in the game, like adding new animations, enemy behavior, score, and audio. Talked about next steps (playing around with making own game)| 
| October 9, 2024 | Spent a lot of hours in and outside of class working on my own mini game. Decided to make it top down this time to figure something different out. However, I struggled a lot without the tutorial. I downloaded some free assets, made a map and sprite animation, and worked on some wall colliders in the tilemap. However since I was coding from my brain instead of a tutorial I didn't know that there was a line of code I missed to make the colliders work, but I figured it out eventually. Had a lot of other problems too though. Next I am going to try to make an inventory I think? |
| October 10, 2024 | Added some animations to my own game, tried to make an inventory but gave up! Will try again later. Moved on to randomizing spawning some coins on the tilemap, currently working on that. |
| October 15, 2024 | Watched videos about project management styles, discussed as a group and also talked about a timeline. Then worked more on exploring godot functions, tried to duplicate objects by using an instantiate function. |
| October 29, 2024 | For the last few weeks we have been working on project management tasks like the galaxy sleuth project, now we are back to godot. We started our language portfolio projects, I planned out all the sections, reflecting on the learning we did ! Example: <img width="650" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-29 at 12 13 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9310365b-108e-4185-8315-f88b933e411a"> |
| November 26, 2024 | For the last bit we have been working on our portfolios and other project managemet. We are now going back to working with Godot in preparation for our game. I decided to make a simple little game to learn some new Godot mechanics. My game involves planting plants on a farm, pretty much nothing happens you just click on a square and then a plant is planted, however it took me a longggg time to figure out all of that. I had to figure out how to use the mouse to check if things are colliding, check if the mouse is on a specific tile, and other things with the tilemap. I learned a lot about how the tilemap works from  using this, and the different methods that can be accessed from it to help with programming. Also figured out more with signals while trying to check if the mouse entered a specific area using area2D nodes. <img width="578" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 11 59 51â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/727d3411-23f6-43f7-aa44-c6c2483b0df8"> |
